The assembly code defines two functions: test_cube and main. In test_cube, it sets up a stack frame, then stores the numbers 8 and 27 at 
specific locations in memory, simulating the results of calculating cubes for 2 and 3. After that, it 
cleans up the stack and returns. In main, it also sets up a stack frame, calls test_cube, and then returns 0 to indicate success. 
Overall, the code handles function calls and local variables using the stack.

test_cube():
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-4], 8
        mov     DWORD PTR [rbp-8], 27
        nop
        pop     rbp
        ret
main:
        push    rbp
        mov     rbp, rsp
        call    test_cube()
        mov     eax, 0
        pop     rbp
        ret
